# Change Log

All notable changes to the "always--half-full" extension will be documented in this file.

## [0.8.8] - 2024.01.15

Various fixes and tweaks of colors

## [0.8.7] - 2023.09.22

Add support for Zig programming language. Currently supported are:
- functions (single token / no modifiers),
- fields (mo modifiers)
- most of types and complex type types (üòµ‚Äçüí´),
- `comptime` type parameters (treated as generics),
- namespace types,
- build-in function utilities (colored as special functions),
- arithmetic operators (mainly),
- literals.

Unfortunately, LSP lacks:
- parameters,
- most of punctuation and braces, including:
  - at least half of operators,
  - type specifier colons, semicolons, argument / field commas and member access dots,
  - optional type specifier (`?`) and pointer / optional dereference,
  - all brace types: `() {} []`,
  - size / counter specifiers,
-  optionally, modifiers for `self` parameter and local constants.

Additionally, further toned-down whitespace markers opacity.

## [0.8.6] - 2023.09.11

Add "support" for MSSQL / T-SQL / PL-SQL. Actual theming is extremely limited, due to little to no grammar / semantics for:
- variables,
- database names,
- table names,
- column / `as` alias names,
- stored procedures names,

even in situations, that could be clearly resolved from basic context of syntax.

## [0.8.5] - 2023.09.11

Fix Pythons value-keyword (`None`, `True`, etc.) coloring (to `keyword` from `variable.constant`).

## [0.8.4] - 2023-09-10

Minor bug fixes related to cursors in editor and terminal.

## [0.8.3] - 2023-08-08

Minor tweaks in semi-transparent colors, including:
- whitespace markers,
- diff-editor backgrounds,
- find-and-replace backgrounds,
- menus and other hovering surfaces.

Also added border to current line in dark variants for consistency.

## [0.8.2] - 2023-08-02

Remove showcase animations from production package.

## [0.8.1] - 2023-08-02
